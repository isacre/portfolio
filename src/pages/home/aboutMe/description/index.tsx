          My journey began in 2021, when I decided to change careers and, in
          just 6 months of intense dedication, I got my first job in the field.
          Since then, I've been constantly evolving, accumulating experience in
          complex end-to-end projects and seeking <b>continuous evolution</b>{" "}
          both in my technical skills and interpersonal skills.
