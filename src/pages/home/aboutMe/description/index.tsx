      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        I'm 25 years old and live in Amap√°. For over 4 years I've been working
        as a <b>full-stack developer</b> with a focus on <b>front-end</b>,
        creating modern, performant and scalable web solutions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My journey began in 2021, when I decided to change careers and, in just
        6 months of intense dedication, I got my first job in the field. Since
        then, I've been constantly evolving, accumulating experience in complex
        end-to-end projects and seeking <b>continuous evolution</b> both in my
        technical skills and interpersonal skills.
      </p>
      <br />
